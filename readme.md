## Presentation

landrop+ is an NVDA add-on for the Windows version of Landrop that makes it very easy to select your destination device, iPhone, or Android.

Landrop is a file transfer application over Wi-Fi between Windows PCs and iPhones or Android smartphones.

The advantages of Landrop compared to cloud services are as follows:

* The transfer between your PC and iPhone is direct and very fast, going through your home Wi-Fi network.
* Your files don't take a detour of several hundred or even thousands of kilometers in both directions to pass between your two devices located in the same room.
* This solution is completely free and does not depend on a limited or costly cloud service.

Its only limitation is that it doesn't give you access to your home network when you're away from home.

## Transferring Files from PC to iPhone with Landrop

* Launch Landrop on your PC and on your iPhone and prevent the latter from going into sleep mode.
* On your PC, press Windows+B, select the Landrop icon with the arrow keys, and then press Applications or Shift+F10.
* In the context menu, go down to "Send files" and press Enter.
* In the "Select file(s) to be sent" dialog, press Tab until you reach the "add" button, and then press Enter.
* The standard Windows file open dialog opens in the folder that you configured earlier in the "Settings" dialog.
* Select one or more files.
* Tab to the "file name" field and press Enter.
* Back in the Landrop Select files to be sent window, the Add button is still selected. You can press Enter on it to add more files.
* You can verify the list of files to be sent by pressing Shift+Tab from the "Add" button to reach it. Use the up and down arrows to navigate this list.
* When you're satisfied, tab to the "Send" button and press Enter.
* The "Send to" dialog opens. Wait until NVDA stops saying "Send to dialogue, Address".
* This is where the Landrop+ add-on comes into play: with it, choosing the target device becomes very simple.
* Press the down arrow to hear, for example, "iPhone de votreNom, address: 192.168.1.x, port: 5807".
* If you hear "No device found", press the down arrow again.
* With the add-on, your iPhone is found and selected. Simply press Enter to start transferring your files.
* The "Transferring" dialog opens and announces "handshaking" followed by a code.
* The add-on then announces: Please accept this transfer on: iPhone de VotreNom.
* Take your iPhone and in the Landrop screen, look for the name of your computer followed by the code mentioned earlier. To its right, double-tap the voiced button "oque". If it's not always voiced, you can use vibrations to find it. After that, you'll find a "Close" button that allows you to refuse the transfer.<br>
Note that this button is much easier to find with an external keyboard.
* Once the transfer is accepted, you will hear its progress on your computer.
* On your iPhone, the files will be stored in the Landrop folder. In your reading or music application, you will need to import them from this folder.

## Transferring Files from iPhone to PC with Landrop

This part is still a draft.

* Launch Landrop on the PC and on the iPhone.
* On the iPhone, in the Landrop window, touch the name of your iPhone to select it.
* Then, touch one of the two buttons located under the battery indicator on the right:
* Select files to transfer files of any type;
* Select Photos / Videos to access these two specific folders.
* Follow the procedure.
